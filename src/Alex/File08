Hidden story of studyGroup:

I will start in the future, then we will go back to the past, and finally we will proceed to now! Confused? Let me explain...

We are all a group of incredibly successful people still yang, but already wise....
some of us a team leads others work as senior developers, we keep learning and thriving in the IT field!
Our lives are amazing: money, friends, big houses it's all there, but whats even more important is that we are together, ready to help each other any moment...
And it's only a matter of time when we bring the whole IT industry to our knees! WE ARE UNSTOPPABLE!

But it's all in the future.... before all of it I have to take you to the past... remember? Right... Lets go there...

It's lonely and scary here... I'm 1 of 600+... thrown into a wilderness of unknown...
There is a lot of rooms people yelling left and right, which makes it even more scary and confusing...
We have been told that we will have to go trough a lot!
I didnt know whats ahead, but I knew I cant be alone!
- She was the first: Loudest and hyperactive... she was just like me scared and lost...
But she is not the one who sits quietly and waits for the solution being served to her on the silver platter.
She was running around all the rooms, yelling the loudest...
And it was only the matter of time when I met he in the question-answer-room...
She yelled as usually trying to figure things out... I yelled back... She yelled back...I yelled back... She yelled back...I yelled back... She yelled back...
And from that moment we never left each other side...
That was the creation of studyGroup camp...
The only thing left is to gather more teammates... Smart, motivated, driven individuals... Who will be fighting with us against any obstacles thrown at us by CYDEO forces!
Those who show up every day! Those who wont leave, no matter if it's easy or hard!
Did we found them? ... ... ...  YOU GOD DAMN RIGHT WE DID!
